## What can we say about the probabilities of observing multiple 1,000-year tornadoes in thousand years?

Create of a time series

```{r Tornados}
y <- runif(1000)
(obs <- sum(y >= 0.999))
y_long <- matrix(runif(1e6), ncol = 1000)
obs_long <- colSums(y_long >= 0.999)
plot(table(obs_long), lwd = 10,
     main = "Simulated 1,000-year Tornadoes",
     col = "hotpink",
     xlab = "Tornado count",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     cex.lab = 1.5, cex.main = 1.5)
```
